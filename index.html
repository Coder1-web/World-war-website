        <h2>The Origins of World War I</h2>
        <p>World War I, also known as the Great War, started in 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. The world was already on edge due to a complex web of alliances, militarism, nationalism, and imperialist ambitions.</p>

        <p>The war involved many of the world's great powers, divided into two alliances: the Allies (including France, the United Kingdom, and Russia) and the Central Powers (led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, with over 16 million people killed by the time it ended in 1918.</p>

        <h2>Main Causes of World War I</h2>
        <p>The key causes of World War I can be traced back to four main factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Militarism:</strong> The build-up of military forces in major European nations heightened tensions and prepared nations for large-scale war.</li>
            <li><strong>Alliances:</strong> Complex alliances between major powers meant that a conflict involving one nation could quickly involve many others.</li>
            <li><strong>Imperialism:</strong> The scramble for colonies and resources by European powers created tensions and rivalries across the globe.</li>
            <li><strong>Nationalism:</strong> Rising nationalism in Europe, especially in the Balkans, fueled the desire for independence and self-determination, causing unrest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Major Battles of World War I</h2>
        <p>World War I was characterized by trench warfare and large-scale battles. Some of the most significant battles include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Battle of the Somme (1916):</strong> One of the bloodiest battles in human history, with over 1 million casualties.</li>
            <li><strong>The Battle of Verdun (1916):</strong> The longest single battle of World War I, fought between German and French forces.</li>
            <li><strong>The Battle of Ypres (1914-1918):</strong> A series of battles fought in and around the Belgian town of Ypres, marking the widespread use of chemical warfare.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Lead-Up to World War II</h2>
        <p>World War II began in 1939 when Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. This marked the beginning of a global conflict that would last until 1945. Many of the conditions that led to World War II were rooted in the aftermath of World War I, including the harsh conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed severe reparations on Germany, and the global economic depression.</p>

        <h2>Key Events Leading to World War II</h2>
        <p>Several key events escalated tensions and ultimately led to the outbreak of World War II:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Rise of Fascism:</strong> In the 1920s and 1930s, fascist regimes took power in Italy, Germany, and Japan, promoting aggressive expansionist policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Invasion of Manchuria (1931):</strong> Japan invaded Manchuria, beginning a period of militaristic expansion in East Asia.</li>
            <li><strong>The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939):</strong> A conflict that served as a prelude to World War II, with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy supporting the Nationalists.</li>
            <li><strong>The Munich Agreement (1938):</strong> This agreement allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, emboldening Hitler's ambitions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Major Battles of World War II</h2>
        <p>World War II saw some of the most significant battles in human history, with devastating consequences. Notable battles include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Battle of Stalingrad (1942-1943):</strong> One of the bloodiest battles of the war, marking a turning point on the Eastern Front.</li>
            <li><strong>The Battle of Midway (1942):</strong> A decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theatre that turned the tide against Japan.</li>
            <li><strong>The Normandy Invasion (D-Day, 1944):</strong> Allied forces launched a massive invasion of Nazi-occupied France, leading to the liberation of Western Europe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Main Leaders of the World Wars</h2>
        <p>The wars were shaped by many influential leaders, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Woodrow Wilson:</strong> President of the United States during World War I, who promoted the League of Nations.</li>
            <li><strong>Winston Churchill:</strong> Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World War II, known for his leadership and speeches.</li>

            <li><strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt:</strong> President of the United States during most of World War II, leading the country through the Great Depression and into war.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Main Troops and Military Units</h2>
        <p>Both World Wars saw the involvement of millions of troops from various nations. Some key military units include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The British Expeditionary Force (BEF):</strong> A key force in both World War I and World War II, deployed to the Western Front.</li>
            <li><strong>The Wehrmacht:</strong> The unified armed forces of Nazi Germany, responsible for many of the military campaigns in World War II.</li>
            <li><strong>The Red Army:</strong> The Soviet Union's army, playing a significant role in the defeat of Nazi Germany, especially at Stalingrad and Berlin.</li>
            <li><strong>The United States Army:</strong> Played a critical role in both wars, especially during the Normandy landings and the Pacific Theatre in World War II.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Special Persons and Unsung Heroes</h2>
